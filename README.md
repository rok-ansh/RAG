#🚀 Unlocking the Power of RAG: A Step-by-Step PDF Processing Pipeline

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a game-changer for LLM applications, enhancing responses with external knowledge.

This is just the beginning—"Sky is the limit" in RAG, and this introduction sets the foundation for even more advanced implementations!

#🌟 RAG Pipeline for PDF Processing :

1️⃣ Load the PDF 📜
Utilize PyPDFLoader to efficiently extract text from a PDF file.
2️⃣ Chunking the Pages 
Split the text into manageable chunks to enhance retrieval efficiency.
3️⃣ Store Vectors in FAISS 🏗️
Convert text chunks into embeddings and index them using FAISS for fast and scalable retrieval.
4️⃣ Retrieve Relevant Vectors 🔍
Query the FAISS index to fetch the most relevant document embeddings for the given input.
5️⃣ Use Groq Model (LLM) 🤖
Pass the retrieved chunks to a Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware generation.
6️⃣ Parse Output with Runnable & Output Parser 🛠️
Refine and structure the model-generated response using Runnable and OutputParser.
7️⃣ Build the RAG Chain 🔗
Integrate the retrieval and generation steps into a cohesive RAG Chain for seamless interaction.
8️⃣ Ask Anything from the PDF! 🎯
Now, the LLM can answer questions based on the loaded PDF, making complex document analysis effortless.
🚀 This is just the beginning! RAG is reshaping AI workflows, enabling smarter, more context-aware systems.
