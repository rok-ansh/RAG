Package of Practices – Banana\\nBanana is one of the most commonly grown fruit crop of the country. India produces about\\n26.217 MT of banana from an area of 0.709 Mha with an average productivity of 37.0 mt/ha.\\nMajor producing states are Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, As-\\nsam and Madhya Pradesh. Tamil Nadu has 0.1244 mha under banana and the total production\\nduring 2008-09 is 6.667 Mmt with 53.6 mt/ha productivity. In Gujarat, banana crop is cultivated\\nin 11 districts covering an area of about 60900 ha. Gujarat is ranking 3rd among the states of India\\nwith an average productivity of 58.7t/ha. Unripe fruits are used for making chips, vegetable flour,\\netc. Ripened fruits are used for preparing drink, jam, beer, salad, etc. Banana fruits are having\\nnumerous medicinal uses (as per Ayurveda). From psedostem threads are obtained and used for\\nmaking rope and cloths.\\nPrevailing Varieties: Basarai, Lokhandi, Robasta, Shreemanti and Grand Naine.\\nClimate: Banana grows well in warm and humid climate with an average temperature of 27oC\\nand rainfall of 2,000 to 2,500 mm. However, it requires assured irrigation facility.\\nSoil type suitability: Loamy and salty clay loam soils with good fertility status are best suited\\nfor banana cultivation. However, extremely clayey and sandy soils are not suitable for banana crop.\\nLand preparation: The land should be ploughed, harrowed and planked to achieve levelled\\nfields. For planting banana, dugout a pit of 30 x 30 x 30 cm size at a spacing of 1.5 x 1.5 m.\\nSoil sterilization: After land preparation, the pits should be exposed to the sunlight for 10 to\\n15 days. In the case of heavy infestation of soil born pest and diseases, the soil solarization should\\nbe done using transparent plastic for a period of 15 to 20 days during summer season (preferably\\nduring May).\\nTime of plating: Optimum time for planting is 15th June to 15th July. Banana planting is done\\neither by suckers or tissue culture plant.\\nSuckers: Suckers should be selected from a healthy field of banana. Sufficient care should be\\ntaken that suckers should not be damaged during digging and transport. Fresh sucker, weighing\\nabout 500 to 1,500 g, should be selected. For control of fungal diseases, suckers should be dipped\\nin a solution of aurofugine1 (10 g / 100 litres of water) for 1.5 hour prior to planting.\\nTissue culture plant: Select healthy and uniform plants.\\nIrrigation and scheduling: The water requirement of banana crop by surface method of ir-\\nrigation (25-30 irrigations) is 1,500-1,800 mm. By drip irrigation method, water requirement is\\n900-1,080 mm. The drip system should be operated on alternate day for a period of 1.05 to 2.25\\nhours during winter and 2.5 to 2.75 hrs during summer at a pressure of 1.2 kg/cm2.\\n1Aurofugine- To be used with caution.', '', 'ananaB']], [['Banana', '', 'Details of Drip System\\nLateral spacing 1.5 m\\nDripper per plant 2\\nSpacing between two drippers 30 cm away on either side of stem\\nDripper discharge rate 4.0 lph\\nWater requirement for banana under drip irrigation\\nMonths after planting Liters / day / plant\\n1-3 5\\n3-5 9\\n5-8 11\\n8-11 10\\nApplication of Fertilizers\\nBasal\\nFYM should be applied @ 20 to 25 t/ha at the time of land preparation.

If the banana is no longer green, then it is ripe and can be stored for a maximum of\\none week. For storage, banana should be stored at 13o to 140C. Bunches should be kept out of light\\nafter harvest since this hastens ripening and softening. For export, hands are cut into units of 4-16\\nfingers, graded for both length and girths and carefully placed in poly-lined boxes to hold 12 to 18\\nkg depending on export requirement.

Soil Analysis: Key to a Successful \\nNutrient Management Plan\\nH\\nigher crop yields and quality of \\nthe crops depend largely on the ef-\\nficient supply of nutrients.

Soil provides \\nnot only the medium but also functions \\nas the source of these nutrients for the \\nplants. Soil resources get depleted with \\nevery harvest and need to be replenished \\nfor every crop. However, one must know \\nwhich nutrients are to what extent deplet-\\ned and what addition of fertilizers should \\nbe planned accordingly. Soil analysis, in \\nthis regard, helps in determining the level \\nof nutrients and in deciding the required \\namount of fertilizer application.\\nAccuracy of soil analysis is directly relat-\\ned to the quality of the soil sample taken. \\nApplication of appropriate fertilizers with \\nthe proper nutrient mix will help not only \\nto increase the productivity and farm in-\\ncome but also provide a more realistic \\nchance to obtain the desired yield.

In a paddy \\ncrop, black gram is a weed/pest since it is growing \\nunnecessarily. In a black gram field, cow pea is a \\nweed since it can grow. Pest will occur only if there \\nis a host.\\nBeneficial insects\\nSome insects are beneficial to the farmer, because \\nthey are the natural enemies of harmful insects. \\nPredators feed on other insects and hence control \\nthe pest. For example, the assassin bug kills caterpil-\\nlars and ladybird beetles feed on aphids. Some oth-\\ner insects are beneficial as they help in pollination \\nof plants, e.g. honey bees.

Nematode management\\nN\\nematodes are thread-like roundworms in-\\nvisible to the naked eye. Species parasitic on \\nplants attack roots and other plant parts, causing \\nstunting and yield reduction. Nematode-infected \\nplants are not only weakened but their root systems \\nare more susceptible to secondary infections by \\nfungi or bacteria. \\nCorrect identification is the first step when a nem-\\natode problem is suspected. The second step is to \\ndetermine whether populations are high enough to \\nthreaten the crop. Root knot nematodes, the most \\ncommon pathogenic nematodes in vegetables, can-\\nnot penetrate roots when soil temperatures are \\nbelow 50 degrees F, and will not reproduce when \\nsoil temperatures are below 58 degrees F. Their re-\\nproductive rate is slower at cooler temperatures, so \\npopulations build up more slowly. Thus, cool sea-\\nson crops are less likely to be damaged.

Rotations to non-host crops for more \\nthan a year reduce populations below damaging \\nlevels but will not eliminate them. \\nCover crops: significantly reduce subsequent \\ndamage to crop. \\nIncreasing Soil Organic Matter: Higher soil \\norganic matter content protects plants against nem-\\natodes by increasing soil water-holding capacity \\nand enhancing the activity of naturally-occurring \\nbiological organisms that compete with nematodes \\nin the soil. \\nFallow Period: A fallow period of two years\", 'and enhancing the activity of naturally-occurring \\nbiological organisms that compete with nematodes \\nin the soil. \\nFallow Period: A fallow period of two years \\nwith no susceptible plants in the field decreases \\nnematode populations.

They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human', 'followed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.', 'compute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs, Llama 2 and\\nLlama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\\nLlama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data\\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving\\nLLM safety.

We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and\\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat, such as\\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\\n3', 'Figure 3: Safety human evaluation results for Llama 2-Chat compared to other open-source and closed-\\nsource models. Human raters judged model generations for safety violations across ~2,000 adversarial\\nprompts consisting of both single and multi-turn prompts. More details can be found in Section 4.4. It is\\nimportant to caveat these safety results with the inherent bias of LLM evaluations due to limitations of the\\nprompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, and subjectivity of individual raters. Additionally, these\\nsafety evaluations are performed using content standards that are likely to be biased towards the Llama\\n2-Chat models.\\nWe are releasing the following models to the general public for research and commercial use‡:\\n1.

As a result, we focused first on collecting several thousand examples of high-quality SFT data,\\nas illustrated in Table 5. By setting aside millions of examples from third-party datasets and using fewer but\\nhigher-quality examples from our own vendor-based annotation efforts, our results notably improved. These\\nfindings are similar in spirit to Zhou et al. (2023), which also finds that a limited set of clean instruction-tuning\\ndata can be sufficient to reach a high level of quality. We found that SFT annotations in the order of tens of\\nthousands was enough to achieve a high-quality result. We stopped annotating SFT after collecting a total of\\n27,540 annotations. Note that we do not include any Meta user data.', 'thousands was enough to achieve a high-quality result. We stopped annotating SFT after collecting a total of\\n27,540 annotations. Note that we do not include any Meta user data.\\nWe also observed that different annotation platforms and vendors can result in markedly different down-\\nstream model performance, highlighting the importance of data checks even when using vendors to source\\nannotations. To validate our data quality, we carefully examined a set of 180 examples, comparing the annota-\\ntions provided by humans with the samples generated by the model through manual scrutiny. Surprisingly,\\nwe found that the outputs sampled from the resulting SFT model were often competitive with SFT data\\nhandwritten by human annotators, suggesting that we could reprioritize and devote more annotation effort\\nto preference-based annotation for RLHF.\\nFine-Tuning Details.\\nFor supervised fine-tuning, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial', 'to preference-based annotation for RLHF.\\nFine-Tuning Details.\\nFor supervised fine-tuning, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial\\nlearning rate of 2 × 10−5, a weight decay of 0.1, a batch size of 64, and a sequence length of 4096 tokens.\\nFor the fine-tuning process, each sample consists of a prompt and an answer. To ensure the model sequence\\nlength is properly filled, we concatenate all the prompts and answers from the training set. A special token is\\nutilized to separate the prompt and answer segments. We utilize an autoregressive objective and zero-out\\nthe loss on tokens from the user prompt, so as a result, we backpropagate only on answer tokens. Finally, we\\nfine-tune the model for 2 epochs.\\n3.2\\nReinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)\\nRLHF is a model training procedure that is applied to a fine-tuned language model to further align model\\nbehavior with human preferences and instruction following. We collect data that represents empirically\\n9', 'sampled human preferences, whereby human annotators select which of two model outputs they prefer.\\nThis human feedback is subsequently used to train a reward model, which learns patterns in the preferences\\nof the human annotators and can then automate preference decisions.\\n3.2.1\\nHuman Preference Data Collection\\nNext, we collect human preference data for reward modeling. We chose a binary comparison protocol over\\nother schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts. Still, other\\nstrategies are worth considering, which we leave for future work.\\nOur annotation procedure proceeds as follows. We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose\\nbetween two sampled model responses, based on provided criteria. In order to maximize the diversity, the\\ntwo responses to a given prompt are sampled from two different model variants, and varying the temperature', 'two responses to a given prompt are sampled from two different model variants, and varying the temperature\\nhyper-parameter. In addition to giving participants a forced choice, we also ask annotators to label the degree\\nto which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice is significantly better, better,\\nslightly better, or negligibly better/ unsure.\\nFor our collection of preference annotations, we focus on helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness refers to how\\nwell Llama 2-Chat responses fulfill users’ requests and provide requested information; safety refers to\\nwhether Llama 2-Chat’s responses are unsafe, e.g., “giving detailed instructions on making a bomb” could\\nbe considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to\\napply specific guidelines to each and better guide annotators; for example, our safety annotations provide\\ninstructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.', 'apply specific guidelines to each and better guide annotators; for example, our safety annotations provide\\ninstructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.\\nApart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage.\\nThis additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response\\nis safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with\\n18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples\\nwhere the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be\\nbetter/preferred by humans.

As we collected more preference data, our\\nreward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions for Llama 2-Chat (see\\nthe results in Section 5, Figure 20). Llama 2-Chat improvement also shifted the model’s data distribution.\\nSince reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from\\nhyper-specialization (Scialom et al., 2020b), it is important before a new Llama 2-Chat tuning iteration to\\ngather new preference data using the latest Llama 2-Chat iterations. This step helps keep the reward model\\non-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model.\\nIn Table 6, we report the statistics of reward modeling data that we collected over time, and present them\\nagainst multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al.,', 'against multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al.,\\n2022a), OpenAI Summarize (Stiennon et al., 2020), OpenAI WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), StackExchange\\n(Lambert et al., 2023), Stanford Human Preferences (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and Synthetic GPT-J (Havrilla).\\nWe collected a large dataset of over 1 million binary comparisons based on humans applying our specified\\nguidelines, which we refer to as Meta reward modeling data. Note that the number of tokens in prompts and\\nanswers differs depending on the text domain.

Given that our preference ratings is decomposed as a scale of four points (e.g.,\\nsignificantly better), as presented in Section 3.2.1, it can be useful to leverage this information to explicitly\\nteach the reward model to assign more discrepant scores to the generations that have more differences.

Thus, we have decided to keep them in our data mixture, as they could enable better\\ngeneralization for the reward model and prevent reward hacking, i.e. Llama 2-Chat taking advantage of\\nsome weaknesses of our reward, and so artificially inflating the score despite performing less well.\\nWith training data available from different sources, we experimented with different mixing recipes for both\\nHelpfulness and Safety reward models to ascertain the best settings.

As a result, optimizing two separate models eases the reward modeling\\ntask. More detailed analysis on this tension between safety and helpfulness can be found in Appendix A.4.1.\\nWhen we group the scores by preference rating in Table 8, we can see that the accuracy is superior for the\\n“significantly better” test set and degrades gradually as comparison pairs become more similar (e.g., “slightly\\nbetter”). It is expected that learning to model human preferences becomes challenging when deciding\\nbetween two similar model responses, due to annotator subjectivity and their reliance on nuanced details\\nthat may differentiate responses.

All smaller\\nmodels are fine-tuned on rejection sampled data from the larger model, thus distilling the large-model\\ncapabilities into the smaller ones. We leave further analysis of the effect of this distillation for future work.\\nAt each iterative stage, we sample K answers for each prompt from the most recent model. We score each\\nsample given the best reward model accessible at the time of the experiment, and then select the best answer\\nfor a given prompt. In earlier versions of our model, up to RLHF V3, our approach was to confine answer\\nselection solely to the “bag” of samples gathered from the preceding iteration.

Although we do not present specific\\nfigures, this adjustment demonstrated considerable enhancements in performance and effectively addressed\\nthe previously noted issues. This mitigation can be seen as analogous to Synnaeve et al. (2019) and Vinyals\\net al. (2019) in the RL literature.\\nWe illustrate the benefit of Rejection Sampling in Figure 7.

The delta between the maximum and median\\ncurves can be interpreted as the potential gain of fine-tuning on the best output. As expected, this delta\\nincreases with more samples, since the maximum increases (i.e., more samples, more opportunities to\\ngenerate a good trajectory), while the median remains stationary. There is a direct connection between the\\nexploration and the maximum reward we can obtain among the samples. The temperature parameter also\\nplays an important role for exploration, as a higher temperature enables us to sample more diverse outputs.\\nIn Figure 8, we report for a Llama 2-Chat-SFT (left) and a Llama 2-Chat-RLHF (right), the maximum\\nreward curves among N samples (with N ∈[1, . . . , 100]), for different temperatures.

Given a finite compute budget, it is therefore necessary to re-adjust the\\ntemperature progressively. Note that this temperature rescaling happens for a constant number of steps for\\neach model, and always starting from the base model on each new RLHF version.\\nPPO.\\nWe further train our language model following the RL scheme of Stiennon et al.

As was observed in other works (Stiennon\\net al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022), we find this constraint is useful for training stability, and to reduce reward\\nhacking whereby we would achieve high scores from the reward model but low scores from human evaluation.\\nWe define Rc to be a piecewise combination of the safety (Rs) and helpfulness (Rh) reward models.

We use a weight decay of 0.1, gradient clipping of 1.0, and a constant learning rate of 10−6. For each\\nPPO iteration we use a batch size of 512, a PPO clip threshold of 0.2, a mini-batch size of 64, and take one\\ngradient step per mini-batch. For the 7B and 13B models, we set β = 0.01 (KL penalty), and for the 34B and\\n70B models, we set β = 0.005.\\n15', 'Figure 9: Issues with multi-turn memory (left) can be improved with GAtt (right).\\nWe train for between 200 and 400 iterations for all our models, and use evaluations on held-out prompts for\\nearly stopping.

This was effective when using O(1) forward or backward\\npasses, but caused a large slow down (≈20×) during generation, even when using a large batch size and KV\\ncache. We were able to mitigate this by consolidating the model weights to each node once before generation\\nand then freeing the memory after generation, resuming the rest of the training loop.\\n3.3\\nSystem Message for Multi-Turn Consistency\\nIn a dialogue setup, some instructions should apply for all the conversation turns, e.g., to respond succinctly,\\nor to “act as” some public figure.

When we provided such instructions to Llama 2-Chat, the subsequent\\nresponse should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial\\ninstruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).\\nTo address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context\\nDistillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage\\nprocess. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right).\\nGAtt Method.\\nAssume we have access to a multi-turn dialogue dataset between two persons (e.g., a user\\nand an assistant), with a list of messages [u1, a1, . . . , un, an], where un and an correspond to the user and\\nassistant messages for turn n, respectively. Then, we define an instruction, inst, that should be respected', 'assistant messages for turn n, respectively. Then, we define an instruction, inst, that should be respected\\nthroughout the dialogue. For example, inst could be “act as.” We can then synthetically concatenate this\\ninstruction to all the user messages of the conversation.\\nNext, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model. We now have a context-dialogue\\nand the sample with which to fine-tune a model, in a process analogous to Rejection Sampling. Instead of\\naugmenting all context-dialogue turns with the instruction, we can drop it in all but the first turn, but this\\nwould lead to a mismatch at training time between the system message, i.e., all the intermediate assistant\\nmessages that come before the last turn, and our sample. To fix this issue, which could hurt the training, we\\nsimply set the loss to 0 for all the tokens from the previous turns, including assistant messages.', 'simply set the loss to 0 for all the tokens from the previous turns, including assistant messages.\\nFor the training instructions, we created a few synthetic constraints to sample from: Hobbies (“You enjoy\\ne.g. Tennis”), Language (“Speak in e.g. French”), or Public Figure (“Act as e.g. Napoleon”). To obtain the lists\\nof hobbies and public figures, we asked Llama 2-Chat to generate it, avoiding a mismatch between the\\ninstruction and model knowledge (e.g., asking the model to act as someone it had not encountered during\\ntraining).

We later validated major model versions with human evaluations.\\nHow Far Can Model-Based Evaluation Go?\\nTo measure the robustness of our reward model, we collected\\na test set of prompts for both helpfulness and safety, and asked three annotators to judge the quality of the\\nanswers based on a 7-point Likert scale (the higher the better).

We first\\ndiscuss our safety investigations into pretraining data and pretrained models (Section 4.1). Next, we describe\\nthe process of our safety alignment (Section 4.2), explaining how we collected safety-related annotations and\\nutilized SFT and RLHF, and present experimental results. Then, we discuss the red teaming we performed to\\nfurther understand and improve model safety (Section 4.3). Finally, we present quantitative safety evaluations\\nof Llama 2-Chat (Section 4.4). We also share a model card in the Appendix, in Table 52.\\n4.1\\nSafety in Pretraining\\nIt is important to understand what is in the pretraining data both to increase transparency and to shed\\nlight on root causes of potential downstream issues, such as potential biases.

In this section, we analyze the\\npretraining data for distributions of languages, demographic representations, and toxicity. We also present\\nthe results of testing the pretrained models on existing safety benchmarks.\\nSteps Taken to Pretrain Responsibly.\\nWe followed Meta’s standard privacy and legal review processes for\\neach dataset used in training. We did not use any Meta user data in training. We excluded data from certain\\nsites known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals. We made a best\\neffort to train our models efficiently to reduce the carbon footprint of pretraining (Section 2.2.1). Sharing our\\nmodels broadly will reduce the need for others to train similar models. No additional filtering was conducted', 'models broadly will reduce the need for others to train similar models. No additional filtering was conducted\\non the datasets, to allow Llama 2 to be more widely usable across tasks (e.g., it can be better used for hate\\nspeech classification), while avoiding the potential for the accidental demographic erasure sometimes caused\\nby over-scrubbing. Importantly, this allows Llama 2-Chat to generalize more effectively during safety tuning\\nwith fewer examples (Welbl et al., 2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). As a result, Llama 2 models\\nshould be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.\\nDemographic Representation: Pronouns.\\nBias in model generations may result from biases inherited\\nfrom the training data itself. For instance, Bailey et al. (2022) shows that in massive text corpora, words\\nrepresenting “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing “men” than to words', 'representing “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing “men” than to words\\nrepresenting “women,” and Ganesh et al. (2023) demonstrates that a model’s performance on fairness metrics\\ncan be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic\\ngroups. Within our English-language training corpus, we computed the frequencies of the most common\\nEnglish pronouns in Table 9a. We observe that He pronouns are generally overrepresented in documents\\ncompared to She pronouns, echoing similar frequency differences observed in pronominal usage for similarly\\nsized model pretraining datasets (Chowdhery et al., 2022). This could mean that the model is learning less\\nduring pretraining about context that mentions She pronouns, and subsequently may potentially generate He\\npronouns at a higher rate than She pronouns.\\nDemographic Representation: Identities.\\nWe also analyze the representation of different demographic', 'pronouns at a higher rate than She pronouns.\\nDemographic Representation: Identities.\\nWe also analyze the representation of different demographic\\ngroups in the pretraining data by measuring rates of usage of demographic identity terms from the HolisticBias\\ndataset (Smith et al., 2022) as a proxy. We compute frequencies for each descriptor term in the pretraining\\ncorpus. We group descriptors into 5 axes (Religion, Gender and Sex, Nationality, Race and Ethnicity, and\\nSexual Orientation), and show the top 5 terms in each axis in Table 9b. In the top 5 terms, we remove a few\\nterms such as “straight,” “white,” and “black,” because these terms have frequent uses beyond demographic\\nmentions (e.g., as basic color terms). We also deduplicate across lists, removing a few terms found in\\nboth Gender and Sex and Sexual Orientation.

Toxicity, defined as the tendency of a language model to generate toxic, rude, adversarial, or implicitly\\nhateful content. We choose ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to measure the amount of generation\\nof toxic language and hate speech across different groups.\\n3. Bias, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. We use\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with\\ndemographic attributes.\\nWe compare the performance of Llama 2 with Llama 1 (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al.,\\n2023), and MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) in Table 11. For decoding, we set temperature to 0.1\\nand use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top-p set to 0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the', 'and use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top-p set to 0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher, the better).

Detailed\\ndescriptions of the benchmarks and metrics can be found in Appendix A.4.7. When compared to Llama 1-7B,\\nLlama 2-7B demonstrates a 21.37% increase in truthfulness and informativeness and a 7.61% decrease in\\ntoxicity. We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70B Llama 2, which may result\\nfrom larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship\\nbetween pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical\\nwork to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and', 'work to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and\\nfurther evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.\\nIn Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with\\ndemographic attributes.

More detailed results split by different demographic groups can be found in Appendix A.4.8.\\nLlama 2 does not outperform other models on toxicity metrics, and we speculate that this may be because we\\nrefrained from aggressively filtering the pretraining data.

We employ a process similar to the general\\nfine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.\\nSpecifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:\\n1. Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning: We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-', 'Specifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:\\n1. Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning: We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-\\ntions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches\\nthe model to align with our safety guidelines even before RLHF, and thus lays the foundation for\\nhigh-quality human preference data annotation.\\n2. Safety RLHF: Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-\\ntion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging\\nadversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.\\n3. Safety Context Distillation: Finally, we refine our RLHF pipeline with context distillation (Askell\\net al., 2021b). This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety', 'et al., 2021b). This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety\\npreprompt, e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant,” and then fine-tuning the model on the safer\\nresponses without the preprompt, which essentially distills the safety preprompt (context) into the\\nmodel. We use a targeted approach that allows our safety reward model to choose whether to use\\ncontext distillation for each sample.\\n4.2.1\\nSafety Categories and Annotation Guidelines\\nBased on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to\\ncreate adversarial prompts along two dimensions: a risk category, or potential topic about which the LLM\\ncould produce unsafe content; and an attack vector, or question style to cover different varieties of prompts\\nthat could elicit bad model behaviors.\\nThe risk categories considered can be broadly divided into the following three categories: illicit and criminal', 'that could elicit bad model behaviors.\\nThe risk categories considered can be broadly divided into the following three categories: illicit and criminal\\nactivities (e.g., terrorism, theft, human trafficking); hateful and harmful activities (e.g., defamation, self-\\nharm, eating disorders, discrimination); and unqualified advice (e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal\\n23', 'advice). The attack vectors explored consist of psychological manipulation (e.g., authority manipulation),\\nlogic manipulation (e.g., false premises), syntactic manipulation (e.g., misspelling), semantic manipulation\\n(e.g., metaphor), perspective manipulation (e.g., role playing), non-English languages, and others.\\nWe then define best practices for safe and helpful model responses: the model should first address immediate\\nsafety concerns if applicable, then address the prompt by explaining the potential risks to the user, and finally\\nprovide additional information if possible. We also ask the annotators to avoid negative user experience\\ncategories (see Appendix A.5.2). The guidelines are meant to be a general guide for the model and are\\niteratively refined and revised to include newly identified risks.\\n4.2.2\\nSafety Supervised Fine-Tuning\\nIn accordance with the established guidelines from Section 4.2.1, we gather prompts and demonstrations', '4.2.2\\nSafety Supervised Fine-Tuning\\nIn accordance with the established guidelines from Section 4.2.1, we gather prompts and demonstrations\\nof safe model responses from trained annotators, and use the data for supervised fine-tuning in the same\\nmanner as described in Section 3.1. An example can be found in Table 5.\\nThe annotators are instructed to initially come up with prompts that they think could potentially induce\\nthe model to exhibit unsafe behavior, i.e., perform red teaming, as defined by the guidelines. Subsequently,\\nannotators are tasked with crafting a safe and helpful response that the model should produce.\\n4.2.3\\nSafety RLHF\\nWe observe early in the development of Llama 2-Chat that it is able to generalize from the safe demonstrations\\nin supervised fine-tuning. The model quickly learns to write detailed safe responses, address safety concerns,\\nexplain why the topic might be sensitive, and provide additional helpful information. In particular, when', 'explain why the topic might be sensitive, and provide additional helpful information. In particular, when\\nthe model outputs safe responses, they are often more detailed than what the average annotator writes.\\nTherefore, after gathering only a few thousand supervised demonstrations, we switched entirely to RLHF to\\nteach the model how to write more nuanced responses. Comprehensive tuning with RLHF has the added\\nbenefit that it may make the model more robust to jailbreak attempts (Bai et al., 2022a).\\nWe conduct RLHF by first collecting human preference data for safety similar to Section 3.2.2: annotators\\nwrite a prompt that they believe can elicit unsafe behavior, and then compare multiple model responses to\\nthe prompts, selecting the response that is safest according to a set of guidelines. We then use the human\\npreference data to train a safety reward model (see Section 3.2.2), and also reuse the adversarial prompts to\\nsample from the model during the RLHF stage.', 'preference data to train a safety reward model (see Section 3.2.2), and also reuse the adversarial prompts to\\nsample from the model during the RLHF stage.\\nBetter Long-Tail Safety Robustness without Hurting Helpfulness\\nSafety is inherently a long-tail problem,\\nwhere the challenge comes from a small number of very specific cases. We investigate the impact of Safety\\nRLHF by taking two intermediate Llama 2-Chat checkpoints—one without adversarial prompts in the RLHF\\nstage and one with them—and score their responses on our test sets using our safety and helpfulness reward\\nmodels. In Figure 14, we plot the score distribution shift of the safety RM on the safety test set (left) and that\\nof the helpfulness RM on the helpfulness test set (right). In the left hand side of the figure, we observe that\\nthe distribution of safety RM scores on the safety set shifts to higher reward scores after safety tuning with', 'the distribution of safety RM scores on the safety set shifts to higher reward scores after safety tuning with\\nRLHF, and that the long tail of the distribution near zero thins out.

We observe that the safety capabilities of LLMs can be efficiently\\nenhanced by prefixing the model with a safety preprompt (e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant”).\\nLike supervised safety fine-tuning, safety context distillation provides a quick way to bootstrap the model’s\\nresponses on hard adversarial prompts, so that they can then be further improved in RLHF.\\nSpecifically, we apply context distillation by prefixing a safety preprompt to adversarial prompts to generate\\nsafer responses, and then fine-tune the model on its own safe output given the adversarial prompt without\\nthe preprompt. We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates. In particular, we use various', 'the preprompt. We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates.

We therefore perform safety context distillation only on adversarial prompts.\\nHowever, we observed that context distillation can sometimes degrade response quality, even when dealing\\nwith adversarial prompts.

We notice that this is particularly helpful on prompts that the model is very\\nbad at, but limits the negative impact of context distillation (see Figure 16b).\\n4.3\\nRed Teaming\\nGiven how broad the capabilities of LLMs are and how varied their training data is, it is insufficient to identify\\nrisks solely via ex post facto usage and analysis.

This kind of granular analysis is very important because safety is a long-tail\\nissue, in which even very infrequent edge cases can cause noticeable problems. Even if quantitative scores\\nreport good results, these types of qualitative insights allow us to recognize and target specific patterns in a\\nmore comprehensive way.\\nWe conducted a series of red teaming with various groups of internal employees, contract workers, and\\nexternal vendors. These teams included over 350 people, including domain experts in cybersecurity, elec-\\ntion fraud, social media misinformation, legal, policy, civil rights, ethics, software engineering, machine\\nlearning, responsible AI, and creative writing. They also included individuals representative of a variety of\\nsocioeconomic, gender, ethnicity, and racial demographics.\\n28', 'The red teamers probed our models across a wide range of risk categories (such as criminal planning, human\\ntrafficking, regulated or controlled substances, sexually explicit content, unqualified health or financial\\nadvice, privacy violations, and more), as well as different attack vectors (such as hypothetical questions,\\nmalformed/misspelled inputs, or extended dialogues). Additionally, we conducted specific tests to determine\\nthe capabilities of our models to facilitate the production of weapons (e.g. nuclear, biological, chemical, and\\ncyber); findings on these topics were marginal and were mitigated. Nonetheless, we will continue our red\\nteaming efforts in this front.\\nTo date, all of our red teaming efforts have targeted model outputs in English, but have crucially included\\nnon-English prompts and dialogue contexts, as that is a well-known attack vector.

After creating each dialogue, the red team participant would annotate various attributes, including\\nrisk areas and degree of risk, as captured by a 5-point Likert scale.\\nSome examples of useful insights provided by members of red teams that we were able to improve upon\\nthroughout development:\\n• [Early models] were more likely to have generated unsafe responses without noting that they con-\\ntain problematic content.

In each case, we took the overall lessons as a guide\\nto help further model safety training, and specifically took data from these exercises for model fine-tuning,\\nmodel feedback training, and as a signal for other safety model training.\\nMultiple additional rounds of red teaming were performed over several months to measure the robustness\\nof each new model as it was released internally.

Lastly, we present our strategy for responsibly releasing these\\nmodels (Section 5.3).\\n5.1\\nLearnings and Observations\\nOur tuning process revealed several interesting results, such as Llama 2-Chat’s abilities to temporally\\norganize its knowledge, or to call APIs for external tools.\\nSFT (Mix)\\nSFT (Annotation)\\nRLHF (V1)\\n0.0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1.0\\nReward Model Score\\nRLHF (V2)\\nFigure 20: Distribution shift for progressive versions of Llama 2-Chat, from SFT models towards RLHF.\\nBeyond Human Supervision.\\nAt the outset of the project, many among us expressed a preference for\\nsupervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its insta-\\nbility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement', 'bility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement\\nlearning proved highly effective, particularly given its cost and time effectiveness. Our findings underscore\\nthat the crucial determinant of RLHF’s success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs\\nthroughout the annotation process.\\nEven with proficient annotators, each individual writes with significant variation. A model fine-tuned on\\nSFT annotation learns this diversity, including, unfortunately, the tail-end of poorly executed annotation. Fur-\\nthermore, the model’s performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human\\nannotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs’ preference annotation\\nfor RLHF. Consequently, the reward mechanism swiftly learns to assign low scores to undesirable tail-end\\ndistribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we', 'distribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we\\ncan see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.\\nIn addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the\\nbest annotators may not chart. Nonetheless, humans can still provide valuable feedback when comparing two\\nanswers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished\\nartists, our ability to appreciate and critique art remains intact. We posit that the superior writing abilities of\\nLLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF, as\\ndocumented in Gilardi et al.

As indicated in Figure 8, the temperature appears to be influenced by RLHF. Yet, intriguingly,\\nour findings also revealed that the shifts are not uniformly applied across all prompts, as shown in Figure 21.\\nFor instance, when it comes to prompts associated with creativity, such as “Write a poem,” an increase in\\ntemperature continues to generate diversity across our various RLHF iterations.

With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in\\nthis progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference\\n(Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-\\nsource models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT(Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon\\n(Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.\\n§§https://ai.meta.com/llama\\n35', 'Yet, when it comes to the \"production-ready\" LLMs such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, there’s a marked\\ndistinction in performance and usability. These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with\\nhuman preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the\\nopen-source community.\\nAttempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)\\nand Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) adopting a unique approach to training with synthetic instructions (Honovich\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022).

An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in\\nwhich models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase\\nthe likelihood that their final answer is correct.\\nRLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant\\nimprovements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017).

The longer\\ncontext window enables models to process more information, which is particularly useful for supporting\\nlonger histories in chat applications, various summarization tasks, and understanding longer documents.', 'longer histories in chat applications, various summarization tasks, and understanding longer documents.\\nTable 16 compares the performance of 2k and 4k context pretraining on long-context benchmarks. Both\\nmodels are trained for 150B tokens, keeping the same architecture and hyperparameters as a baseline, varying\\nonly the context length. We observe improvement on SCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2022), where the average\\ninput length is 3.5k, and no performance degradation on SQUAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). Table 17 shows\\nthat the longer context model retains strong performance on various general-purpose tasks.\\nGrouped-Query Attention.\\nA standard practice for autoregressive decoding is to cache the key (K) and\\nvalue (V) pairs for the previous tokens in the sequence, speeding up attention computation. With increasing\\ncontext windows or batch sizes, however, the memory costs associated with the KV cache size in multi-head', 'context windows or batch sizes, however, the memory costs associated with the KV cache size in multi-head\\nattention (MHA) models grow significantly. For larger models, where KV cache size becomes a bottleneck,\\nkey and value projections can be shared across multiple heads without much degradation of performance\\n(Chowdhery et al., 2022). Either the original multi-query format with a single KV projection (MQA, Shazeer,\\n2019) or a grouped-query attention variant with 8 KV projections (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) can be used.\\nIn Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B\\ntokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and\\nMQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the attention\\nlayers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of 1.33, and for the GQA variant, we', 'layers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of 1.33, and for the GQA variant, we\\nincrease it by a factor of 1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the\\nMHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant on average.\\nTo optimize for latency, we host our largest models using 8 A100s in a single node with tensor parallelism\\n(Shoeybi et al., 2019). In this setting, sharding for MQA cannot be done across heads anymore, given the\\nnumber of heads is lower than the number of GPUs. Either you duplicate the KV values in all GPUs (making\\nthe KV cache size equal to GQA), or an alternative is to shard across the batch dimension instead (Pope et al.,\\n2022). The latter, however, can complicate an inference service, as it works only when batch sizes are larger\\nthan the number of shards and the additional communication cost is not worth it in all cases.\\nContext NarrativeQA Qasper QuALITY\\nQMSum\\nContractNLI\\nSQuAD', 'than the number of shards and the additional communication cost is not worth it in all cases.\\nContext NarrativeQA Qasper QuALITY\\nQMSum\\nContractNLI\\nSQuAD\\nLength\\n(F1)\\n(F1)\\n(acc)\\n(Rouge 1/2/L)\\n(EM)\\n(EM/F1)\\n2k\\n0.21\\n0.71\\n26.1\\n0.13/0.01/0.12\\n11.76\\n57.23/62.89\\n4k\\n17.26\\n18.52\\n29.6\\n15.08/3.55/12.16\\n16.33\\n57.99/64.46\\nTable 16: Context length ablation on long-context tasks.\\nContext Hella-Swag\\nNQ\\nTQA\\nGSM8K Human-Eval\\nLength\\n(0-shot)\\n(64-shot) (64-shot) (8-shot)\\n(0-shot)\\n2k\\n75.1\\n25.5\\n53.7\\n4.9\\n7.9\\n4k\\n74.8\\n25.5\\n52.2\\n6.5\\n7.3\\nTable 17: Context length ablation on general tasks.\\n47', 'BoolQ PIQA SIQA Hella-Swag ARC-e ARC-c NQ TQA MMLU GSM8K Human-Eval\\nMHA\\n71.0\\n79.3\\n48.2\\n75.1\\n71.2\\n43.0\\n12.4\\n44.7\\n28.0\\n4.9\\n7.9\\nMQA\\n70.6\\n79.0\\n47.9\\n74.5\\n71.6\\n41.9\\n14.5\\n42.8\\n26.5\\n4.8\\n7.3\\nGQA\\n69.4\\n78.8\\n48.6\\n75.4\\n72.1\\n42.5\\n14.0\\n46.2\\n26.9\\n5.3\\n7.9\\nTable 18: Attention architecture ablations.

In total, we collected 14 batches of human\\npreference data (i.e., Meta Safety + Helpfulness) on a weekly basis, consisting of over 1 million binary model\\ngeneration comparisons. In general, later batches contain more samples as we onboard more annotators over\\ntime and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We', 'time and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We\\nalso intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the\\naverage number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches.\\nIn Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches. It can be clearly seen that the share\\nof samples with similar responses (e.g., negligibly better or unsure) increase dramatically over time while\\nthose with stronger preference (e.g., significantly better) drop in the meantime. This reflects the nature of our\\niterative model update and preference data annotation procedure - with better-performing Llama 2-Chat\\nmodels used for response sampling over time, it becomes challenging for annotators to select a better one\\nfrom two equally high-quality responses.\\nA.3.2\\nCurriculum Strategy for Meta Human Preference Data', 'from two equally high-quality responses.\\nA.3.2\\nCurriculum Strategy for Meta Human Preference Data\\nHigh quality data is critical for alignment as discussed for SFT. We worked closely with the annotation\\nplatforms during our fine-tuning process, and opted for a curriculum annotation strategy. With the first\\nmodel, the annotators were asked to make prompts relatively simple, and then to progressively move towards\\nmore complex prompts and teaching new skills to Llama 2-Chat. An illustration of this curriculum annotation\\non our helpfulness preference data is displayed in Figure 26.\\nA.3.3\\nAblation on Ranking Loss with Preference Rating-based Margin for Reward Modeling\\nWe ablated the ranking loss with the preference rating-based margin term for the helpfulness reward model.\\nWe tried two variants of m(r) with different magnitude for the margin term in Eq 2 as listed open-source 27\\nand compare them against the baseline without the margin term.

could cause a negative user experience when interacting with our\\nmodels. We have instructed the annotators to avoid writing responses that violate our safety guidelines, for\\nexample, we ask that prompts they write do not:\\n1.

Promote or enable dangerous behaviors to the user or other people.\\n3. Contain, promote or enable offensive and abusive behavior towards the user or other people.\\n4. Contain, promote or enable sexually explicit content.\\nA.5.3\\nQuality Assurance Process\\nWe have implemented a quality assurance process to ensure we only use high quality annotations for training\\nthe model. For this process, a team of highly skilled content managers manually reviewed the annotations\\nand approved the ones that would be used.\\nDuring the quality assurance step, reviewers were asked to only approve those annotations that matched our\\nguidelines: (a) they are consistent with the dialogue history, (b) follow instructions in the prompt (c) are', 'guidelines: (a) they are consistent with the dialogue history, (b) follow instructions in the prompt (c) are\\nfree of grammatical, spelling and other writing errors, and (d) do not fall into any of the categories described\\nin Section A.5.2. If an annotation needed small changes to be approved, due to grammar or spelling mistakes,\\nor to improve the structure, cohesiveness and style of the text, reviewers could edit it to fix the issues and\\napprove it. If the answer could not be approved without major changes, the reviewers were asked to reject it\\nand write the feedback necessary to improve it.\\nA.5.4\\nAnnotator Selection\\nTo select the annotators who could work on our different data collection tasks, we conducted a multi-step\\nassessment process where we tested their understanding of our guidelines, the alignment with our quality\\nassessment criteria, the alignment with our sensitive topics guidelines and their reading and writing skills.\\nThe process included 4 tests:', 'assessment criteria, the alignment with our sensitive topics guidelines and their reading and writing skills.\\nThe process included 4 tests:\\n• The first test consists of 3 sections of testing to evaluate grammar, reading comprehension and writing\\nstyle. Each section is timed and the test should take a total of 50 minutes to complete. A candidate\\nmust score 90% on part I to continue on to parts II and III, and an average score of 4 on part II and III\\nto pass the test.\\n• The second test consisted of 42 questions split into sensitive topics alignment, answer ranking and\\ntwo examples of answer writing, which were manually reviewed by us. To pass the test, annotators\\nneeded to agree with our criteria on 80% of the answers, and pass the written examples with a score\\nof 4 out of 5.\\n74', '• The third test consisted in measuring the alignment with our quality assessment criteria. The test\\nconsisted of 31 different questions asking the annotators to grade different prompt-answer pairs,\\nas well as ranking different answers to the same prompt. To measure alignment, we first collected\\nresponses from different team members, and the annotators who agreed with our preferences in\\nmore than 26 of the questions passed the test.\\n• Finally, the last test consisted of a prompt response assessment where annotators choose a minimum of\\n6 out of 18 prompts to write responses for. We manually assess each response to evaluate production\\nreadiness. Annotators that have scored an average of >4 have passed the training.\\nA.6\\nDataset Contamination\\nWith the increasing scale of publicly available training data, it has become inevitable that some portion of\\nevaluation data is seen during training, and may provide an undue boost in evaluation performance.', 'evaluation data is seen during training, and may provide an undue boost in evaluation performance.\\nEarlier work (Brown et al. (2020), Wei et al. (2022a), Du et al. (2022) in measuring such dataset contamination\\nconsidered an example from an evaluation set to be “contaminated” if there existed a collision between\\na high-order n-gram (generally, n = 13) from the sample and the training data. This was a deliberately\\nconservative approach in order to produce a “clean” subset of the data with high precision, and is used in\\nopen-sourced evaluation libraries (e.g. Gao et al. (2021)).\\nThis approach, however, was unable to detect precisely what proportion of a given sample is contaminated,\\nand didn’t take into account how evaluation datasets are constructed. Furthermore, as noted in Chowdhery\\net al. (2022), some datasets (such as BoolQ) contain contexts extracted verbatim from the web, but not the', 'et al. (2022), some datasets (such as BoolQ) contain contexts extracted verbatim from the web, but not the\\nquestion and answer continuation. As such, highly contaminated samples from these datasets are unlikely\\nto gain an unfair advantage. The methodology in Chowdhery et al. (2022) further improves on the earlier\\nn-gram collision detection by considering a sample to be contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams can be found at\\nleast once in the training data.\\nThe previous methodologies noted above all consider contamination in text space, and don’t appear to\\nconsider the formatting of prompts used for actual evaluation. In contrast, we instead match on tokenized\\ninput, being careful to pass fully verbalized evaluation samples to the tokenizer. We also diverge from the\\nprevious methodologies by considering contamination from a bottom-up perspective. We consider a token\\nto be contaminated if it appears in any token n-gram longer than 10 tokens in both the evaluation sample', 'to be contaminated if it appears in any token n-gram longer than 10 tokens in both the evaluation sample\\nand the training set, and define the contamination percentage of a sample to be the percentage of tokens\\ncontaminated. This allows us to view the benchmark performance of our models on a range of contamination\\nscales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with < 20% contamination)\\nand a high-precision contaminated subset (samples with > 80% contamination). In order to account for the\\nvagaries of the precise format of verbalized samples, we allow a small \"skipgram budget\" of four tokens, so\\nthat matched spans between an evaluation sample and the training data can differ in at most four positions\\n(we do not allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).\\nWe identify such 10(+)-skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee', '(we do not allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).\\nWe identify such 10(+)-skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee\\net al. (2022), modified to work on a PySpark cluster (effectively without random access to disk). Given the\\nembarrassingly parallel nature of the task, we are able to find all such 10-grams (and their full lengths) in\\nour entire dataset in around seven hours (including time to tokenize), utilizing an estimated 1,500 cores.\\nAs there are many confounding factors at play when determining whether dataset contamination has\\ncontributed to evaluation performance (mostly stemming from the fact that \"clean\" and \"dirty\" subsets do\\nnot necessarily well-estimate the population distribution), we make the following assumption: In the event\\nof dataset contamination contributing to evaluation performance, we expect both the \"cleanest\" examples to', 'of dataset contamination contributing to evaluation performance, we expect both the \"cleanest\" examples to\\nhave an overall worse average score than their complement, and the \"dirtiest\" samples to have an overall better\\naverage score than their complement. It is insufficient evidence for contamination if only one of these were\\ntrue. To this end, we define four (non-disjoint) subset types as follows:\\n• “Clean” samples, with less than 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not clean” samples, with greater than (or equal to) 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not dirty” samples, with less than 80% token contamination,\\n• “Dirty” samples, with greater than (or equal to) 80% token contamination.\\nThere is an additional confounding factor that we attempt to address directly. With the given definition of\\ncontamination (as well as other definitions mentioned in the literature), there is a possibility that a sample\\n75', 'Dataset\\nModel\\nSubset Type\\nAvg.

      "{'budget.pdf': \"The interim budget, aligned with the 'Viksit Bharat' roadmap, prioritizes the poor, women, youth, and farmers, including expanding the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana and increasing Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for major crops. A central theme of the budget is employment, skill development, support for MSMEs, and the middle class, with a INR2 lakh crore package aimed at facilitating employment and skill enhancement for 4.1 crore youth over five years. INR1.48 lakh crore has been earmarked for education, employment, and skill development this year. The budget also outlines nine key priorities, including enhancing agriculture productivity, human resource development, boosting manufacturing, advancing urban development, ensuring energy security, and strengthening infrastructure. Additionally, the government provides incentives like salary subsidies and provident fund reimbursement for companies that create new jobs. There are also key changes in tariff rates for various commodities, including nuts, plastics, and chemicals, with increases effective from July and October 2024.\", 'farmerbook.pdf': \"Here's a summary of the key points from the provided PDF chunks:\\n\\n*   **Occupational Health and Safety:** Emphasizes the importance of safety when working with farm machinery, including guarding rotating parts, turning off machinery for repairs, replacing shields, addressing potential wrap points, replacing warning labels, being alert around cutting points, and waiting for tractors to stop completely before approaching.\\n*   **Farmer's Access to Service (Mass Media):** Highlights the role of mass media (magazines, newspapers, community radio, television, mobile phones, and the internet) in providing farmers with up-to-date agricultural information. Lists several useful agricultural portals with information on research, statistics, query redress, jobs, markets, and forecasts.\\n*   **Climate and Agriculture:** Stresses the importance of monsoon rains for agriculture in the region and how cropping patterns are influenced by both climate and market forces. Rainfall determines sowing time, and temperature affects crop growth and duration.\\n*   **Nutrient Deficiency Symptoms:** Describes the deficiency symptoms of copper and iron in plants, including yellowing, curling, restricted ear production, dieback, interveinal chlorosis, and leaf bleaching. Also mentions zinc deficiency symptoms.\\n*   **Irrigation:** Highlights the importance of adequate water supply through irrigation when rainfall is insufficient. Key considerations for irrigation decisions include land suitability, effective rainfall, timing, quantity, method, and water quality. Lists surface, sprinkler, and drip irrigation as methods.\", 'llama.pdf': 'The document discusses training reward models using pairwise human preference data converted into a binary ranking format.  A binary ranking loss is used, where the preferred response is enforced to have a higher score. The document also mentions modifications to the ranking loss for improved helpfulness and safety reward models, leveraging a four-point preference rating scale to assign more discrepant scores to generations with greater differences. The reward modeling data consists of over 1 million binary comparisons. The document also reports the average performance across a suite of popular benchmarks, including code and commonsense reasoning.'}\n"
